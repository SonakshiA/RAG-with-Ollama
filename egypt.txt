Egypt spans northeastern Africa and the Sinai Peninsula into southwest Asia, with coastlines along the Mediterranean Sea to the north and the Red Sea to the east.
Its land borders touch Libya in the west, Sudan in the south, and Israel and the Gaza Strip to the northeast. The country covers over 1 million square kilometers, stretching approximately 1,420 km north‑south and 1,275 km east‑west, and possesses nearly 2,900 km of coastline including the Gulf of Suez and Gulf of Aqaba.

The heart of Egypt is the Nile River Valley, a narrow corridor of fertile land carved through vast desert. Ancient Egyptians referred to this rich floodplain as Kemet, the "Black Lands," contrasted with the surrounding desert, Deshret. 
Civilization flourished here for millennia, forming one of history’s most enduring societies.

Egypt’s civilization emerged around 3100 BCE when King Narmer unified Upper and Lower Egypt, initiating the dynastic era. During the Old Kingdom (c. 2686–2181 BCE), the great pyramids at Giza were constructed. This was followed by political fragmentation during the First Intermediate Period, after which the Middle Kingdom (c. 2040–1782 BCE) reestablished stability and cultural renewal. 
The New Kingdom (c. 1570–1069 BCE) marked Egypt’s imperial zenith, with rulers such as Ahmose I and Ramesses II expanding influence into Nubia and the Levant, and constructing monumental sites like Karnak, Luxor, and Abu Simbel.

The architectural legacy includes the Great Pyramid of Giza, temples with elaborate pylon gateways, hypostyle halls, obelisks, and hieroglyphic inscriptions. 
Columns often mimic papyrus or lotus plants. 
Ancient Egyptian construction featured precise fitting of massive stone blocks and astronomical alignment. Greco‑Roman, Coptic, Islamic, Ottoman, and modern architectural influences followed in successive eras, with 19th‑century rulers like Muhammad Ali introducing European styles alongside Neo‑Mamluk revival, and later modern projects such as the Bibliotheca Alexandrina and Cairo Tower.

Egyptian culture is rooted in ancient heritage but has continued evolving through Christianity and Islamic influence. 
Hieroglyphics developed around 3150 BCE, supplemented by cursive hieratic script for everyday texts. Egyptians made early advances in medicine, astronomy, mathematics, geometry, and calendars—dividing the year into ancient flood‑based seasons. 
Their religious beliefs centered on gods like Ra, Osiris, Isis, and Horus. Pharaohs were regarded as divine mediators and elaborate funerary practices, including mummification, aimed to secure an afterlife journey .

In modern times, Cairo has grown into a bustling metropolis combining Islamic and modern elements. 
Alexandria, founded by Alexander the Great, was long a center of Hellenistic learning and still holds landmarks such as the modern Bibliotheca Alexandrina and Roman catacombs. 
Culturally, Egypt blends Islamic, Coptic Christian, Arab, and global influences. Most Egyptians are Sunni Muslim, with Coptic Christians comprising about 5 to 15 percent of the population.

Tourism has become a pillar of Egypt’s economy.
Egypt welcomed a record 15.7 million tourists in 2024, exceeding the 2023 figure of 14.9 million. 
Tourism revenues hit $14.1 billion in 2024. 
The government aims to bring 30 million visitors annually by 2028 through expanding hotel capacity, visa reforms, and improving infrastructure; growth is forecast to continue into 2025 and beyond with tourism contributing significantly to national GDP and employment.

Egypt’s tourism market continues to attract growing interest. Aussies have shifted from crowded European destinations to Egypt, with bookings up 170 percent year‑on‑year thanks to improved infrastructure, warm climate, streamlined visas, and wide open spaces. 
Despite general travel advisories urging caution in certain regions due to terrorism risk, popular areas such as Luxor, Cairo, Hurghada, Sharm el‑Sheikh, and Aswan remain generally safe for visitors.

Recent archaeological discoveries include a decorated tomb believed to belong to Pharaoh Thutmose II near Luxor, shedding new light on Eighteenth Dynasty history. 
A major research breakthrough using cosmic-ray muon radiography revealed a 30-meter void above the Grand Gallery inside the Great Pyramid of Khufu, the first significant internal structure discovered since the 19th century. 
Egypt continues to preserve and showcase its heritage with initiatives like the Grand Egyptian Museum near Giza and modernizing ticketing systems to digital, cashless payment across major sites for improved visitor experience 

Egypt remains a crossroads of continents and civilizations. Its ancient legacy lives on in monumental temples, timeless inscriptions, and enduring mythologies. 
Its modern identity is shaped by economic reforms, tourism revival, and cultural continuity. The country pursues a future aligned with archaeological stewardship, national development, and global significance
